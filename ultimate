      <p>Ultimate Frisbee is a sport that i never played myself,but it's popularity is something hard to ignore in many Midwestern college
      towns. Students (and people who wish they were still students)spend the few brief months of good weather,sprinting down feilds ,
      hurling ,and yelling"Stack!!".
      </p>
      <p>What I find much more entertaining iis the large number of people who continue to play when the weather gets windy and the night
      sky darkens oh....4:15pm. The sight of fribsee boomeranging in the wind is topped onlu by the knowledge that even when you 
      can't seem, those same plastic discs of death are probably hurtling through the dark night sky at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening</p>
      <p>Ultimate Fribsee requires a great deal of stamina and dexterity. Not surprisingly ,the IOC officially recognized Ultimate as a 
      sport in 2015. It can go up aganist other sports for inclusion in Olympic games.</p>
